# KMK AI — Audio Specification: The Core of Sovereignty

## ACOUSTIC STACK: THE GENESIS SCORE

**Tempo (BPM):** 68 (Slow, deliberate, rhythmic breathing)
**Key:** C# Minor (Deep, resonant, slightly mysterious)

## MOOD PROGRESSION
- **Phase I (00s-05s):** Sub-bass drone. Grainy textures representing "The Void." Low-pass filtered noise.
- **Phase II (05s-10s):** Introduction of analog synth pulses. A high-frequency "crystalline" shimmer on every 4th beat.
- **Phase III (10s-15s):** Orchestral layers added — muted cellos performing a descending three-note motif. Dynamic build-up as the lattice stabilizes.

## INSTRUMENTATION
- **Foundation:** Moog-style sub-oscillator.
- **Complexity:** Granular synthesis of glass-breaking sounds (timestretched 1000%).
- **Elegance:** A single solo cello with heavy reverb (Plate).
- **Precision:** Digital "tick" sounds periodically, perfectly synced to the lattice vertices pulsing.

## SOUND DESIGN INTENT
The audio must feel tactile. The listener should feel the "weight" of the logic lattice as it forms.
