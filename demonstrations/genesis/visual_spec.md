# KMK AI — Visual Specifications: The Core of Sovereignty

## IMAGE PROMPT: THE COGNITIVE LATTICE (4K UHD)
**Concept:** A macro, cinematic shot of a crystalline logic structure.
**Prompt:**
Macro cinematography of a complex geometric lattice made of translucent amber crystal and liquid gold filaments, suspended in a dark matte-black vacuum. Shot on ARRI ALEXA 65 with a 65mm T2.1 Prime lens. Lighting: Strong rim light (KMK Gold #E5B80B) creating sharp highlight glints on the crystal edges, soft cool fill from the left. Micro-texture realism: Visible internal imperfections within the crystal, subtle dust particles caught in the light rays. Color grading: Deep blacks, rich high-contrast gold tones. 4K UHD Resolution.

## VIDEO SPECIFICATION: THE IGNITION SEQUENCE
**Scene Duration:** 15.0 Seconds
**Camera Movement:** Super-low-speed Dolly-In (Physical Move).
**Framing:** Starts Medium, ends in extreme Close-Up on a single logic vertex.
**Lighting Dynamics:**
- 00s-02s: Pitch Black (Ambient: 0)
- 02s-05s: Pulse of light at 5600K begins to build.
- 05s-15s: Full Cinematic Gold Rim-Lighting active.
**Environment Dynamics:** Subtle gravitational ripples around the lattice nodes.
**Narration Sync:** Sequence ends exactly as the narrator says "...architect of the next era."
