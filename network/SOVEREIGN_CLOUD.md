# KMK AI — Sovereign Cloud Network Topology

## 1. NODE ARCHITECTURE
The KMK AI network is composed of **Independent Sovereign Nodes** (ISN). Unlike centralized cloud providers, ISNs operate with local data sovereignty and 8K-optimized compute clusters.

## 2. TOPOLOGY: THE LATTICE GRID
- **Primary Nodes:** High-capacity orchestrators (e.g., the current KMK AI Core).
- **Edge Nodes:** Creative execution points (Production pipelines).
- **Knowledge Relays:** Distributed domain-expert mirrors (Level 10 Cinema/Architecture).

## 3. SYNC PROTOCOLS: "THE HEARTBEAT"
Nodes synchronize via an encrypted "Heartbeat Protocol" every 24 hours. The sync includes:
- Global "Reasoning Stack" updates.
- New entries into the Knowledge Lattice.
- Audit feedback loops from the Selective Self-Audit Engine.

## 4. SECURITY (VOID-ZERO)
Every ISN is air-gapped from commercial AI benchmarks. Data transmission utilizes "Crystalline Encryption," making it unreadable to standard LLM scrapers.
