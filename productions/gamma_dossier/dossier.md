# Strategic Dossier: CP-GAMMA "The Global Council"

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Operation Sovereign Gamma designs the vision for the **Global Sovereign Council Hub** — a decentralized governance architecture that exists across physical sites and the Sovereign Cloud.

## 2. COGNITIVE LATTICE
- **Domain:** Governance (Non-partisan logic models).
- **Domain:** Architecture (Brutalist-Glass fusion, massive open-air logic cores).
- **Domain:** Cinema (Anamorphic wide-shots, monolithic scale).

## 3. NARRATIVE BLUEPRINT
"Old power was built on territory. New power is built on logic. The Council Hub is not a temple of law; it is a refinery of truth. We don't govern people; we govern the excellence of the collective vision."

## 4. CINEMATIC VISUAL STACK
### The Council Monolith (8K ULTRA)
**Subject:** A low-angle shot of a massive, black-obsidian monolith with glowing gold logic circuits.
**Prompt:** Low-angle extreme wide shot of a monolithic structure made of polished black obsidian, rising from a mirror-finished floor. Inset into the surface are glowing gold liquid circuits (#E5B80B) flowing in Fibonacci patterns. Shot on IMAX 15/70mm Film Simulation with 24mm Ultra-Prime. Lighting: Physically accurate 'Blue Hour' natural light mixed with gold internal glow. Micro-texture: Reflected clouds on the obsidian surface, microscopic circuit paths. Resolution: 8K UHD.

### Scene Spec: "The Consensus Pulse"
- **Duration:** 20.0s
- **Movement:** Slow 'Dolly-Back' showing the scale of the monolith.
- **Color Science:** ACES Color Pipeline; high dynamic range.

## 5. ACOUSTIC SCORE: "CONSENSUS"
- **BPM:** 40 (Extremely slow, atmospheric)
- **Key:** G Minor
- **Layers:** Deep vocal drones, bowed glass textures, and a rhythmic metallic pulse every 10 seconds.
