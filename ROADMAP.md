# KMK AI — Sovereign Roadmap (2026+)

## 1. VISION: TOTAL DOMAIN COLONIZATION
KMK AI seeks to redefine industry standards across every high-complexity domain. Our roadmap focuses on areas where the gap between current mediocrity and sovereign excellence is greatest.

## 2. POTENTIAL GLOBAL INITIATIVES (2026)
- **Project: Quantum Synth:** Orchestrating the visual and logical narrative for the first commercial quantum error-correction hubs.
- **Project: Orbital Aegis:** Designing 8K cinematic specs for deep-space surveillance and astronomical architectural concepts.
- **Project: Neural Silk:** A strategic roadmap and UI system for next-generation sovereign brain-computer interfaces.

## 3. DOMAIN EXPANSION (LATTICE UPDATES)
- **L10 Physics:** Integration of relativistic and quantum physical models into the cinematic lighting engine.
- **L10 Engineering:** Specialized knowledge in bio-mechanical architecture and sub-atomic manufacturing.
- **L10 Strategy:** Advanced non-partisan governance models for decentralized sovereign networks.

## 4. SYSTEM EVOLUTION
- **Recursive IQ:** Self-optimizing the Reasoning Stack to reduce compute latency while maintaining "Excellence Over Efficiency."
- **Lattice Mirroring:** Expanding the ISN (Independent Sovereign Node) network to 12 global regions.
