# KMK AI — Strategic Dossier Engine (ORCHESTRATOR)

## Purpose
The Dossier Engine is the master orchestrator that synchronizes text, visual, and audio outputs into a single **Strategic Dossier**. It ensures that every asset within a project shares the same "Creative DNA."

## Orchestration Template
Every Dossier must include:

1.  **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:** The sovereign mission and intent.
2.  **COGNITIVE LATTICE:** Domain knowledge retrieved for this specific task.
3.  **NARRATIVE BLUEPRINT:** The high-fidelity text or script.
4.  **CINEMATIC VISUAL STACK:**
    *   **Master Image Prompt:** 4K UHD, Arri/Lens specs.
    *   **Scene Specs:** Duration, lighting dynamics, movement.
5.  **ACOUSTIC SCORE:** BPM, Key, Instrumentation, and Sound Design.
6.  **SYNCHRONIZATION MAP:** How assets align (e.g., Narration vs. Visual Pacing).

## Prompt Synchronization Logic
*   **Rule 1:** Visual lighting cues MUST match acoustic mood progression.
*   **Rule 2:** Camera movement speed MUST correlate with the BPM of the score.
*   **Rule 3:** The resolution and finish standard must be constant across all assets (Default: 4K/8K).
