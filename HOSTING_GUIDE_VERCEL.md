# KMK AI — Sovereign Hosting Guide: 3-Step Masterclass

Hello. To host your **Sovereign Dashboard** on the internet, we are going to follow a simple "Box, Bridge, Shop" logic.

## 🟢 LESSON 1: THE BOX (Local Git)
Imagine your `KMK AI` folder is full of loose papers. Before we send them to the internet, we need to put them in a organized box. **Git** is the tape that seals that box.
1. **Action:** I will run `git init` to create the box.
2. **Action:** I will run `git add .` and `git commit` to seal it.
*Status: Your code is now "packaged" and ready to travel.*

## 🔵 LESSON 2: THE BRIDGE (GitHub)
Now we need a place to store your box in the cloud so other services can see it. **GitHub** is a massive library for code.
1. **Action:** You go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com).
2. **Action:** Create a New Repository (The shelf for your box).
3. **Action:** Name it `KMK-AI` and set it to **PUBLIC**.
*Status: You now have a "Reserved Shelf" in the cloud.*

## 🔴 LESSON 3: THE SHOP (Vercel)
Finally, we need a storefront that takes the code from GitHub and turns it into a beautiful website. **Vercel** is that storefront.
1. **Action:** Log into [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com) using your GitHub.
2. **Action:** Click "Import" on your `KMK-AI` shelf.
3. **Action:** Tell Vercel that the "Display Window" is in the `ui/dashboard` folder.
*Status: Your site is LIVE at a URL like `kmk-ai.vercel.app`.*

> [!TIP]
> **Why Public?** 
> By making your repo public, you are showing the world that you own a high-fidelity, sovereign intelligence system. It is a broadcast-ready demonstration of excellence.
